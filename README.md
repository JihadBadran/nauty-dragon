**Nauty Dragon** is in progress and can't be used, please be patient with us :) thank you

**Nauty Dragon** is a notifications library which makes it extremely easy to display notifications on your web apps. It is **highly customizable** and enables **you** to stack notifications on top of one another.

**Nauty Dragon**s' main power is that the notification style does not follow any specific design of any library. it is by default, styled with vanila css.
you can build your own notification component. or use the Material UI Snackbar if you want :).
